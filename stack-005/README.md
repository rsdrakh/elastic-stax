###### PREREQUISITES
---
For running the miniobs-recipes(s) you need the following software components on your host system

Name           | Reference    
-------------- | --------------- 
ubuntu         | >= 18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
docker         | [https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)
docker-compose | [https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/)

SETUP
---

01. Clone the miniobs repo ( => if it's already done - skip this point!)

        $ cd ~
        $ mkdir miniobs-ws01
        $ cd miniobs-ws01
        $ git clone https://github.com/prosmc/miniobs.git

02. Initial setup of your environment ( => if it's already done - skip this point!)

        $ cd miniobs
        $ source ./.xrc
        $ x_setup

    **NOTE:** x_setup modifies Kernel parameter and reboots your host system after 30 seconds\
    due to the modifications of the kernel parameter.
      
03. a) Go to the miniobs-005 folder

        $ cd ~/miniobs/miniobs-005

    b) Run the docker-compose command for starting the containers

        $ docker-compose run -d

    **NOTE:** The '.xrc' file contains some short-hand functions for an easier handling. So you\
    can run the 'x_up' command for starting the containers.

        $ . ./.xrc
        $ x_up

    A list of all 'x_*' short-hand commands you can get by running ...

        $ x_cmd

04. Use Kibana

        http://localhost:5601

05. Use the Elasticsearch REST-API via curl

       $ curl -XGET https://localhost:9200


Stop and Start the elastic stack
---

05. Stop the docker containers

        $ docker-compose stop

06. Start the docker containers

        $ docker-compose start 

Remove the entire stack
---

07. Remove the docker containers

        $ docker-compose down -v

    **NOTE:** when you run 'docker-compose down -v' you'll loose all your data too.
